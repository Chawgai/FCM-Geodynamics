# FCM-Geodynamic

This package is GMT and Matlab-based Codes for Clutering evolvation to decipher subsurface geodynamics and stress
patterens, using seismic catalog as input (Longitude, Latitude, and Depth of earthquakes). It produce seismicity 
patterens of the area to be studied, delineate various tectonically regimes distinct from each other. 
The Code is developed at Center of Earthquake Studies (CES), Islamabad, Pakistan.

# code
There are three (3) scripts in the Script folder, a MATLAB script and two GMT scripts. 
The MATLAB script is developed and test on MATLAB R2016a and GMT scripts are developed 
and tested on GMT 6.1.1. All of the work was done using Microsoft Windows 10 Pro. GMT 
scripts were using git terminal but can be run on MS windows command prompt with minor 
changes as well as on linux.
